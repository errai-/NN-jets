# NN-jets
Experimenting with NN jet response regression in colaboratory. Looking at the six leading jets (in pT) in a photon+jets topology to derive the effective jet responses. In the transverse plane, the jet pT's should fully compensate the photon pT. This ends up focusing on the Out-Of-Cone correction at low pT. In-line commenting currently somewhat incomplete, but analysis seems promising and can be extended when time allows.
