# NN-jets
Experimenting with NN jet response regression in colaboratory. Looking at the six leading jets (in pT) to derive the effective jet responses. This ends up focusing on the Out-Of-Cone correction at low pT. In-line commenting currently incomplete, but analysis seems promising and can be extended when time allows.
